## Introduction
The Safety-Critical Automotive Platform (SCAP) is a SaaS project designed to provide a comprehensive solution for the development, testing, and deployment of safety-critical automotive systems. Our platform aims to enable automotive manufacturers and suppliers to develop and deploy Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD) systems that meet the highest safety and security standards.

## Trend Analysis
The 2026 global automotive trends are expected to be dominated by the increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles, electrification, and connected car technologies. With the rise of ADAS and AD, the demand for safety-critical systems is growing rapidly. The automotive industry is shifting towards a more software-centric approach, with a focus on over-the-air (OTA) updates, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, and artificial intelligence (AI).

According to recent reports, the global autonomous vehicle market is projected to reach $556.67 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 39.1% from 2021 to 2026. Furthermore, the increasing emphasis on safety and security has led to the adoption of standards such as ISO 26262, AUTOSAR, and ASIL-D integrity.
