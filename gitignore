This `.gitignore` file is tailored to the Safety-Critical Automotive Platform (SCAP) project, which focuses on the development, testing, and deployment of safety-critical automotive systems. The file ignores non-essential files and directories, including operating system files, IDE and code editor files, compiled and built files, dependencies and libraries, temporary and log files, and other non-essential files. It also takes into account the ISO 26262 standard and ASIL-D integrity, ensuring that essential files for the safety-critical systems are not ignored.
